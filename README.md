# Library

## <u>The Brief</u>

This is the Library project as part of The Odin Project.

We are required to expand upon last lesson about objects and object constructors and build a basic library app.

Each book in the library will be created using a constructor and it will hold a title, an author, number of pages, wether it has been read or not and anything else we might want. Each book is then to be stored in a simple array.
Looping through the array we are then required to display the details of each book. We can display this info either in a table or each book on their own "card".

There needs to be a function to give the user the ability to add a new book, delete a book and also the  ability to change a book's read status.

We are not required to add any type of storage at this stage. Any information that is added will not be saved after refreshing the page. Because of this we are advised to add a few books within the JavaScript code.
